Datasets to look into: yfinance, download huge data frame
Freecodecamp – algorithimic trading


End Goal: have the program predict charts for all companies, model is good enough to understand data and predict
-	Feed in enough data about charts to make it good for predict raw data
-	Learn about chart recognition/characteristics
-	How can we teach models to learn chart characteristics/what should we look for


patternpy – predicting charts
mplfinance – data visualization


Chart Patterns:
Trendlines:
•	Connected series of Higher-highs, higher-lows, lower-highs, or lower-lows
•	This can be done by drawing a line across the peaks or troughs of the chart.
•	Not certain because the trend can be broken and that could be indicative of upward momentum to come.
 
Pennants:
•	Two trendlines intersect, depending on the direction of the flagpole, the pennant indicates an upward or downward move.
•	During the period of formation, the volume tends to decrease
•	They are continuation price indicators

Flags:
•	Similar to pennants, but the trendlines do not intersect, instead they are parallel. 
•	Relies on the flagpole in order to determine the direction of future price movement.
•	They are viewed as a break in the prior direction of movement.
 
Wedges:
•	Similar to a pennant in appearance. Pennants are more symmetrical in appearance whereas wedges have one trendline that has a greater slope. 
•	Volume also decreases during wedge formation.
•	Wedges can be either a continuation or reversal pattern. 

Ascending and Descending Triangles:
•	For ascending, the resistance line intersects with a rising trendline. It gives an idea of where to enter, where to exit, and put a stop loss. 
•	For descending, the support line intersects with a falling trendline of lower highs.  

Cup and Handle:
•	Bullish continuation pattern
•	Cup is a U shape with equal heights on both sides of the cup. Note, it should be a V shaped cup. The handle resembles a flag or pennant. 

Head and Shoulders: 
•	Reversal pattern
•	It can be normal or inverted
•	For a bearish head and shoulders, the first shoulder is a sharp peak, then the head is another peak higher than both shoulders, and the second shoulder is around the same height as the other.  
•	For a bullish head and shoulders, the first shoulder is a trough, then the head is another trough even lower than both shoulders, and the second shoulder goes as far down as the other shoulder.
