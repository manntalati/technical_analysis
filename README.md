# Technical Analysis

The project revolves around utilizing the data we get for a ticker (MSFT for example) and understanding chart patterns to predict future outcomes. As of right now we are analyzing the data that we recieving from yfinance for MSFT and understanding exactly what specific metrics we need to look at and why they are important. For example do we need to look into the moving average? the volume? or the open/closing prices? Additionally, we dived further into the chart patterns and what they may look like with the MSFT data.
